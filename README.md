# TimeCounterForObjects
This repo contains a software which counts and save the entry and exit time of an object appearing in the video. 
Limitation of the software is that it considers two objects as one if the time gap between one's exit and others entry is less than 5 seconds.
Time of entry and exit is recorded and saved in a file named 'output.txt'.
Location of video file should be changed in the line number 5 of the code else for live video streaming keep it '1' or '2' depending on the camera used.
