# TimeCounterForObjects
This repo contains a software which counts and save the entry and exit time of an object appearing in the video. 
Limitation of the software is that it considers two objects as one if the time gap between one's exit and others entry is less than 5 seconds.
Time of entry and exit is recorded and saved in a file named 'output.txt'.
